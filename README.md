Libreoffice + Python + VSCode 

These are my experiences in integrating [Libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and development using [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on Windows 10.

You will need to install the following software:
1. LibreOffice 
2. Miniconda
3. VS Code
